I'm a freelance Front-End Developer interested in unique and beautiful online experiences. I'm especially interested in things that disrupt one's expectations.

I also have a curiosity for Python, data, and all things audio.

The code for how to use an SVG file to write CSS into a README is based off [this](https://github.com/sindresorhus/css-in-readme-like-wat) repository and you can find my CodePen for the above CSS animation [here](https://codepen.io/keenan-h/pen/oNYeYpo).
